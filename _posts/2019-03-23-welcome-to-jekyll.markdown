I am going to graduate from the Master of of Information Management at Peking University in Jun 2021, and I am looking for Ph.D. positions concerning data science in education.

const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
